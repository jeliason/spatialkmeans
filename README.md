# Implementation of Spatial-Kmeans and Comparison of Existing Clustering Algorithms
This R package consists of implementation and comparison of different algorithms. The implementation of Spatial-Kmeans incorporates the idea of "Physical Distance", which requires the model to add an additional physical distance as a penalty. This will generate a different clustering result depending on the penalty parameter $\lambda$. 

The comparison of different algorithms focuses on the different results when changing the algorithms, the parameters each algorithm uses, and the metrics used for benchmarking.
